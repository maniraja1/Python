'''
    Each node can have 3 child nodes. left child (less), middle child(equal), right child (greater)
    consumes less memory
    can be used for sorting operation more efficient than BST
    more efficient than hash maps when it comes to hash collisions or search misses

    With TST you inspect one character at a time and decide if a given key is is available or not.
    With Hashfunction you would use all the caracters in the keys and look for the hash but with TST you may arrive at
    misses after just looking the first few characters in a key

    TST is more space efficient than tries but tries are more performant than TST
    TST is more efficient than hashing and more flexible (because it supports sorting) than BST
