Quick Concept
    A heap is a tree-like data structure where the child nodes have a sort-order relationship with the parents.
    Binary heaps can be represented using a list or array organized so that the children of element N are at positions
    2*N+1 and 2*N+2 (for zero-based indexes).
    This layout makes it possible to rearrange heaps in place, so it is not necessary to reallocate as much memory when
    adding or removing items.
    A max-heap ensures that the parent is larger than or equal to both of its children. A min-heap requires that the
    parent be less than or equal to its children. Pythonâ€™s heapq module implements a min-heap.
Module
    from heapq import nsmallest,heapify,heappop,heappush
Methods
    heapq.heappush  # Push an element to heap
    heapq.heappop   # Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, maintaining the heap invariant.
    heapq.heapify   # Transform list x into a heap, in-place, in linear time.
    heapq.pushpop   # Push item on the heap, then pop and return the smallest item from the heap
    heapq.heapreplace # Pop and return the smallest item from the heap, and also push the new item.
    heapq.merge
    heapq.nlargest # Return a list with the n largest elements from the dataset
    heapq.nsmallest # Return a list with the n smallest elements from the dataset
Notes
    heapify transforms a list to heap in place
    If the heap is empty, IndexError is raised when you run heappop.
    To access the smallest item without popping it, use heap[0].
    A max-heap ensures that the parent is larger than or equal to both of its children.
    A min-heap requires that the parent be less than or equal to its children.
    aq  `Python's heapq module implements a min-heap.
    Example 1.0 Create a heap from list
    Example 2.0 heappush
    Example 3.0 nsmallest
'''
from heapq import nsmallest,heapify,heappop,heappush
# Example 1.0
print('Example 1.0')
x = [10,2,7,3,9,4,8,5]
heapify(x)
print(heappop(x))

# Example 2.0
print('Example 2.0')
x = [10,2,7,3,9,4,8,5]
heapify(x)
print(heappop(x))
heappush(x,1)
print(heappop(x))
